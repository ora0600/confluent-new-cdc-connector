# Oracle Error: ORA-04031: unable to allocate 72 bytes of shared memory ("streams pool", "unknown object", "apply shared t", "KNGLHDR_SPOS")

This error is described in Troubleshooting Guide, see [Oracle Troubleshooting Guide](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/xstrm/troubleshooting-xstream-out.html) and scroll down to: **Problem 1: Streams Pool Size Is Too Small** and  **Problem 2: The Maximum SGA Size for the Capture Process Is Too Small**


```bash

You can set Shared Pool and Stream Pool like this

```bash
sqlplus c#ggadmin@orclcdb
SQL> ALTER SYSTEM SET STREAMS_POOL_SIZE=1G;
SQL> ALTER SYSTEM SET SHARED_POOL_SIZE=10G;
```

If you do not set Stream Pool Size, then the Stream Pool can become max. 10% of Shared Pool
